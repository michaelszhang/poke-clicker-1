This is the source code for a Pokémon-themed Cookie Clicker game. Access the game here: https://michaelszhang.github.io/poke-clicker-1/ (Use Google Chrome!).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Pokémon icons were taken from Veekun, and 3D Pokémon sprites were taken from Project Pokémon.
